1. Run the windows command prompt (cmd) from the project's directory (AutoLab)
2. Switch to 'dev' branch using command: "git checkout dev"
	a. 'dev' is the name of the development branch. USE ONLY THIS BRANCH (and its sub-branched) for developing new features / experiments.
	b. Use this command to validate that your working branch is indeed 'dev': "git branch"
	c. If you are working on a sub-branch of dev switch to it.
	d. A good practice would be creating new sub-branch for a new experiment.
3. Update branch with command: "git pull"
4. Write your new code.
5. Add your new code to the local 'dev' branch using commands:
	a. "git add -p" - this should be used if existing files have been changed. Use 'y' to add changes and 'n' to ignore them.
	b. "git add <new_file1> <new_file2> ..." - this should be used if new files were added
6. Commit your changes on the local 'dev' branch using command: "git commit -m '<changes description>' "
7. Push your changes to the remote repository using command: "git push origin dev"
	a. If you working branch is not 'dev', use your branch name
8. When your new feature is done, merge it to 'main' branch using the following commands:
	a. "git checkout main"
	b. "git pull"
	c. "git checkout dev"
	d. "git merge main" - after this command use "git status" to check on merge failures and fix them
	e. "git push origin dev"
	f. "git checkout main"
	g. "git merge dev"
	h. "git push origin main"
